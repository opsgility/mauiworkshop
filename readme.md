# Building a .NET Maui Application


## Overview

In this hands-on lab, you will use Visual Studio 2022 to build your first .NET Maui application.

We will build a .NET MAUI application that will display a list of Monkeys from around the world. We will start by building the business logic backend that pulls down json-encoded data from a RESTful endpoint. We will then leverage .NET MAUI to find the closest monkey to us and also show the monkey on a map. We will also see how to display data in many different ways and then finally fully theme the application.
